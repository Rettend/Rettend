```
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To fix all the errors in your code,
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

Your palms are sweaty, your keyboard's heavy
There's errors on the screen already, code's spaghetti
You're nervous, but on the surface you look calm and ready
To debug, but you keep on forgetting
What you wrote down, the whole stack trace goes so loud
You open the console, but the words won't come out
You're choking, how? Everybody's joking now
README's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
```
